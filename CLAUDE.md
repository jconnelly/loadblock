# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

LoadBlock is a blockchain-based Bill of Lading (BoL) management system for the trucking industry. The application uses Hyperledger Fabric for immutable document storage and IPFS for PDF document management. The system targets shippers, carriers, consignees, and brokers with a focus on eliminating paper-based inefficiencies and providing a single source of truth for shipping documents.

## Current Development Status

**Phase 1 Complete: 100% - All Objectives Achieved**
- âœ… **Week 1**: Project setup, documentation, CI/CD pipeline, development standards
- âœ… **Week 2**: Database foundation, backend API, authentication system, role-based middleware
- âœ… **Week 3**: Frontend foundation with React.js and Material-UI
- âœ… **Week 4**: Complete BoL operations and testing framework **COMPLETE**

**Phase 2 Progress: Week 6 In Progress (90% Week 5 Complete)**
- âœ… **Week 5**: Hyperledger Fabric network deployed and IPFS operational **COMPLETE**
- ðŸ”„ **Week 6**: PostgreSQL schema setup for pending BoLs and chaincode development **IN PROGRESS**

**Current Focus**: Implementing hybrid storage architecture - PostgreSQL for pending BoLs, Blockchain for approved BoLs

## Architecture Overview

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: React.js with Material-UI, LoadBlock branding colors (#0D47A1, #FF9800, #212121, #1976D2)
- Backend: Node.js/Express with JWT authentication and bcrypt
- Database: PostgreSQL for **pending BoL storage** and user/contact data âœ… DEPLOYED
- Blockchain: Hyperledger Fabric for **approved BoL immutable records** âœ… DEPLOYED
- Storage: IPFS for **PDF document versioning** âœ… DEPLOYED
- Deployment: Docker containers with local development environment

**Hybrid Storage Architecture:**
- **PostgreSQL**: Pending/draft BoLs (mutable, collaborative editing)
- **Blockchain**: Approved BoLs only (immutable, audit trail, status changes)
- **IPFS**: PDF documents only (content-addressed, versioned storage)

**Core Architecture Principles:**
- **Pending Phase**: PostgreSQL stores mutable BoL data for Shipper/Carrier collaboration
- **Approval Trigger**: Dual approval creates first blockchain record + PDF generation + IPFS storage
- **Status Updates**: Every change after approval creates new blockchain transaction + updated PDF + new IPFS hash
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Blockchain maintains history of all IPFS document versions
- **Multi-role system**: Admin > Carrier > Shipper > Broker > Consignee
- **No deletion allowed**: Blockchain ensures immutable compliance record
