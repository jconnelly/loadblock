# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

LoadBlock is a blockchain-based Bill of Lading (BoL) management system for the trucking industry. The application uses Hyperledger Fabric for immutable document storage and IPFS for PDF document management. The system targets shippers, carriers, consignees, and brokers with a focus on eliminating paper-based inefficiencies and providing a single source of truth for shipping documents.

## Current Development Status

**Phase 1 Progress: Week 3 Complete (75% of Phase 1)**
- âœ… **Week 1**: Project setup, documentation, CI/CD pipeline, development standards
- âœ… **Week 2**: Database foundation, backend API, authentication system, role-based middleware
- âœ… **Week 3**: Frontend foundation with React.js and Material-UI **COMPLETE**
- ðŸ“‹ **Week 4**: Basic BoL operations and testing framework (Next)

**Key Achievements:**
- Complete PostgreSQL database schema with migrations
- JWT-based authentication system with bcrypt password hashing
- Express.js API with comprehensive error handling and security
- Role-based access control middleware
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Development standards and code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier)
- **NEW:** Complete React.js frontend with Material-UI and LoadBlock branding
- **NEW:** Authentication components with login/register forms
- **NEW:** Protected routes and role-based navigation
- **NEW:** Responsive dashboard layout with role-specific features
- **NEW:** Full frontend-backend integration with mock API
- **NEW:** Comprehensive testing framework with 9 passing tests

## Architecture Overview

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: React.js with Material-UI, LoadBlock branding colors (#0D47A1, #FF9800, #212121, #1976D2)
- Backend: Node.js/Express with JWT authentication and bcrypt
- Database: PostgreSQL for user/contact data with comprehensive schema
- Blockchain: AWS Managed Blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric) - *Phase 2*
- Storage: IPFS on AWS EC2 instances - *Phase 2*
- Deployment: Docker containers with AWS cloud deployment

**Core Architecture Principles:**
- Every BoL status change creates a new immutable version on the blockchain
- PDF documents are stored on IPFS with content hashes recorded on Hyperledger Fabric
- Multi-role user system with hierarchical permissions: Admin > Carrier > Shipper > Broker > Consignee
- No deletion allowed - blockchain ensures complete audit trail

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Backend Infrastructure
- **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL with users, contacts, and sessions tables
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh mechanism and session tracking

- **Security**: Rate limiting, CORS, helmet security headers, input validation
- **Role-Based Access**: Complete RBAC middleware with permission checking
- **Logging**: Winston-based structured logging with request tracking
- **Testing**: Jest framework setup with coverage reporting
- **Mock API**: Development-ready mock backend for frontend integration testing

### âœ… Completed Frontend Infrastructure
- **React.js Application**: Vite-based setup with TypeScript support
- **Material-UI Integration**: Complete theme with LoadBlock branding colors
- **Authentication System**: Login/register forms with validation and error handling
- **Protected Routes**: Role-based navigation with authentication guards
- **Responsive Layout**: AppBar, drawer navigation, and mobile-responsive design
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest setup with React Testing Library (9 tests passing)
- **State Management**: Context-based authentication state with JWT handling

### ðŸ“‹ Next Implementation Phase (Week 4)
- **Basic BoL Operations**: BoL creation and management components
- **Database Integration**: Connect to real PostgreSQL backend
- **Advanced Forms**: Multi-step BoL creation with validation
- **Enhanced Testing**: Expanded test coverage for BoL operations

## Key Business Logic

**BoL Status Flow:** Pending â†’ Approved â†’ Assigned â†’ Accepted â†’ Picked Up â†’ En Route â†’ Delivered â†’ Unpaid â†’ Paid

**User Roles & Permissions:**
- **Carriers**: Primary status managers, can update most BoL statuses
- **Shippers**: Can create BoLs and approve initial details
- **Consignees**: Can confirm delivery status
- **Brokers**: Coordination and tracking capabilities
- **Admin**: Full system access except cannot modify blockchain records

**BoL Numbering Format:** `BOL-YYYY-NNNNNN` (will be implemented in Phase 1 Week 4)
