This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

LoadBlock is a blockchain-based Bill of Lading (BoL) management system for the trucking industry. The application uses Hyperledger Fabric for immutable document storage and IPFS for PDF document management. The system targets shippers, carriers, consignees, and brokers with a focus on eliminating paper-based inefficiencies and providing a single source of truth for shipping documents.

## Architecture Overview

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: React.js with Material-UI, LoadBlock branding colors (#0D47A1, #FF9800, #212121, #1976D2)
- Backend: Node.js/Express with JWT authentication and bcrypt
- Database: PostgreSQL for **pending BoL storage** and user/contact data âœ… DEPLOYED
- Blockchain: Hyperledger Fabric for **approved BoL immutable records** âœ… DEPLOYED
- Storage: IPFS for **PDF document versioning** âœ… DEPLOYED
- AI Foundation: Database schema and API endpoints for **post-MVP AI features** âœ… READY
- Deployment: Docker containers with local development environment

**Four-Layer Hybrid Storage Architecture:**
- **PostgreSQL**: Pending/draft BoLs (mutable, collaborative editing) + AI data collection
- **Blockchain**: Approved BoLs only (immutable, audit trail, status changes)
- **IPFS**: PDF documents only (content-addressed, versioned storage)
- **AI Data Layer**: Performance metrics, location tracking, payment history (future ML training)

**Core Architecture Principles:**
- **Pending Phase**: PostgreSQL stores mutable BoL data for Shipper/Carrier collaboration
- **Approval Trigger**: Dual approval creates first blockchain record + PDF generation + IPFS storage
- **Status Updates**: Every change after approval creates new blockchain transaction + updated PDF + new IPFS hash
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Blockchain maintains history of all IPFS document versions
- **Multi-role system**: Admin > Carrier > Shipper > Broker > Consignee
- **No deletion allowed**: Blockchain ensures immutable compliance record
- **AI Data Collection**: Transparent data gathering for post-MVP intelligent features
